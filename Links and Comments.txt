For my navigation for my website I got the HTML and Javascript from the following link: 
https://codepen.io/ojbravo/pen/BszEq

I obtained the files for the Bootstrap to download from 
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp


The code for each individual bootstrap was gotten from W3Schools also: 
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/
This particular code was for the Modal included
https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap4/bootstrap_modal.asp

I got help for the form off the following link and changed it around using W3Schools to change parts to an input.

The Bootstrap features I included are: 
A Modal
Buttons 
A Collapsable (multiple types for different types of info) 
A form 
An Input 
A Carousel - this was later deleted as it didn't work well with the website
A Nav bar 
Tables
